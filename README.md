### Brief overview
In the paper we leveraged polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing data derived from a SARS-CoV-2 surveillance program that required mandatory routine SARS-CoV-2 testing of students and departure tests before students left the Ithaca campus. We sought to estimate the effectiveness of COVID-19 boosters in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections in the vaccinated population of students in a period (December 5 - December 31, 2021) during which there was an explosive increase in Omicron cases to the point where the Omicron variant (BA.1) became predominant at Cornell Universityâ€™s Ithaca campus.
